This is just a personal repo for me to solve Project Euler answers. I will try to make them as general as possible (so they could be applied beyond the scope of the Project Euler question). 

I will be doing them in python primarily, but if I feel like I need to practice a new language, I will be using that language instead (Ruby would be my most probable second choice)!
